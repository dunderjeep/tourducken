2013/02/10 : trying to mongoimport to app-root data - file not found
-created a new account
-accidentally scp'ed from new directory and it uploaded - I suspect it was a cache issue - os did not see I had put new data in?
SOLUTION#1 - put the whole thing into one json called pois,taking out all newline, tabs, etc:
{pois:[{"latitude": 44.23985,"date": {"$date": 1338854400},"name": "Home","longitude": -76.49264,"description": "Cliff's home"}]}
SOLUTION#2
mongoimport --jsonarray -db tourducken -c pois --type json --file app-root/data/pois.json -h $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST -u admin -p $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD --ignoreBlanks
 - adding --jsonarray let me put data in without being one key-value, and apparently allows for newlines, ie as a json array
 - added 'b' to '-d' for '-db'
 - had db name wrong - it was 'tourducken' not pois - had to check db name from intialization
 - *important!* changed $OPENSHIFT_NOSQL_DB_HOST, $OPENSHIFT_NOSQL_DB_PASSWORD to  $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD, $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST
